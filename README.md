## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- frontend responsive design
- api with express js
- test api with postman
- add new features on my api
- front end script (fetch, update map, display data from api....)
- dev test
- deploy on render
- test and update



### Built with

#front end
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla js
- vite

#backend
- node js / express js
- axios, cors, nodemon, dotenv


### What I learned
For the curious, try this IP in the search bar: z.z.z.z
Maybe we're neighbors!


### Continued development
For my next project i will use TypeScript.
